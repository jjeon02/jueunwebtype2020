            <h1>What is ornament?</h1>
            <p>According to Google, the term ornament means:</p>
            <br>
            <p class="indent"> A thing used to make something look more attractive but usually having no practical purpose, especially a small object such as a figurine.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
            The ornament has been used as a term for describing making things look “attractive” and “decorative.” Often it has been used as a synonym for “useless” and “just being decorative without purpose.”
            From the perspective of Bauhaus modernism, the ornament was seen as a “supplement” of form. However, people’s perception of ornament has changed over time, especially after the merge of post-modernism. There have been experiments of ornaments, which made it difficult to distinguish what is the ornament and what is not.

            <h1>Korean Ornament?</h1>
            <p>
                To Koreans, the term “design” is relatively new, something that emerged to the public at least in the 90s. A lot of people still think design as a synonym for art and think of designers as similar to painters (which is not completely wrong in certain cases).
                <br><br>
                Korean design history is undeniably a history of colonization and its influence. Korean design education system is just as similar to those of Western countries and students learn Western design history as a whole design history. Above of all, the term “design” is also a Euro-centric term, which we also use in the name of “디자인”.
                <br><br>
                Korea went through colonization and war, which resulted in not only the loss of people also the loss of culture. During colonization, Korea was heavily influenced by Japan’s orientalist point of view that justifies Japanese colonization. After the war, most historical sites are rebuilt in the last 70 years. Through the influence of foreign governments and the loss of history, it became harder and harder for Korea to establish a sense of Korean identity.
                <br><br>
                Korean dictator government seek for establishing “Korean Identity,” which made the Koreans to develop their sense of “Korean” and make it profitable to the foreign countries. One of the most iconic design would be 88 Olympic in Seoul, which is one of the most iconic brand identities of Korea all time. In the olympic design they use Korean patterns, Korean animals, Korean crafts and so on. The sense of “Korean Identity” was forged by the government and it continued the internalized Orientalism.

            <h1>Type and Ornament?</h1>
            <p>
                In classical times like medieval and renaissance, ornaments were the border of books that makes the book look decorative and draw people’s attention. In lots of modernism, editorial works simple ornaments like a block or line are working as a way of supplementing the main context, which is generally type.
                <br><br>
                There had been also experiments with type and ornament experiments. One of the most iconic examples could be the fonts from psychedelic graphic design. The fonts are almost illegible, almost looking like a pattern. However, it still was a method of delivering the message. They were in the grey area of type and ornament.
                <br><br>
                In modern works, there are more grey area between type and ornament and it became easier for people to play around with type with the help of digital type.

                In this work I seek for exploring new relationship between Korean type and ornament, especially in new medium like digital medium.
